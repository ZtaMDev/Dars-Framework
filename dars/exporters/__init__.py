## Introduction

Exporters are the heart of Dars that allow transforming applications written in Python to different technologies and platforms. Each exporter translates Dars components, styles, and scripts to the native code of the target platform.

## Exporter Architecture

### Base Exporter Class

All exporters inherit from the base `Exporter` class:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Exporter(ABC):
    def __init__(self):
        self.templates_path = "templates/"
        
    @abstractmethod
    def export(self, app: App, output_path: str) -> bool:
        '''Exports the application to the specific format'''
        pass
        
    @abstractmethod
    def render_component(self, component: Component) -> str:
        '''Renders an individual component'''
        pass
        
    @abstractmethod
    def get_platform(self) -> str:
        '''Returns the name of the platform'''
        pass
```

### Exportation Flow

1. **Validation**: Verify that the application is valid
2. **Preparation**: Create directory structure
3. **Rendering**: Convert components to the target format
4. **Generation**: Create configuration and dependency files
5. **Finalization**: Write files to the system"""
